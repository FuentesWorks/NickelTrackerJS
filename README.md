NickelTrackerJS
===============

A very basic expense tracker and envelope budgeter built as a Single-Page Application (SPA) in Ember.js, ported from my Symfony2 app [NickelTracker](https://github.com/FuentesWorks/NickelTracker).

The goal is to compile it into a fully functional Cordova / PhoneGap native application.

## Dependencies
jQuery
